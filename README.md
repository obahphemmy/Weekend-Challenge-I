# Weekend Challenge
## Build a Portfolio Website Layout Using Flexbox 

## Introduction

In this challenge you will be building a simple portfolio website based on a given wireframe using the CSS principles covered today.

Portfolio websites are a great way to show off your work to friends, family, and future employers. As you progress through this training you can update this site with projects you're proud of. Similarly, you can change the style, add a blog page, the possibilites are endless.

### Submitted Project Link: __________________________________________

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Codebits' by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
 
### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to create a portfolio site from the wireframe. **You may choose one of the three wireframes in the "Wireframe Options" after your name in the folder above.** Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you have been given, and include all of the following elements:

- [ ]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` that link to the corresponding pages
- [ ]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you
- [ ]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ]  A `My Projects` button that links to the projects page
- [ ]  A `Contact Me` button that links to the contact page
- [ ]  Links to any social media profiles (Instagram, linkedIn, Twitter) into the footer section of your home page
- [ ] Add CSS animations - CSS Transition
- [ ] Host your website on Netlify.com and share the link in the space provided above.

## Submission

- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work (Add your instructor(obahphemmy) as code reviewer)
- [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).
